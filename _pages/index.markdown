The aim of this site is to provide an easy-to-access online materials
for our NutrEpi Work Package 1 (liver) project, which has been recently published
in the [Epigenetics](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/kepi20/current){: .btn} journal.

The main goal of the project is to elucidate the effect of micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) on metabolic pathways from a genetic and epigenetic point of view.

The project is based on the samples collected through a whole life cycle feeding trial (over 54 weeks) of Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) conducted under the EU funded [ARRAINA](https://www.arraina.eu/){: .btn} (advanced research initiatives for nutrition and aquaculture) project.

The next page [project summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/project-summary/){: .btn} presents more detailed project description with the experimental design, followed by a summary of our main findings.
