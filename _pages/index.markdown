We have created this web site to provide an easy access database
for our NutrEpi Work Package 1 (liver) project, which has been published
in the [Epigenetics](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/kepi20/current) journal.

The main aim of the project is to elucidate the effect of micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) on metabolic pathways from a genetic and epigenetic point of view.

It is based on a whole life cycle feeding trial (over 54 weeks) of Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) conducted under the EU funded [ARRAINA](https://www.arraina.eu/) (advanced research initiatives for nutrition and aquaculture) project.

In the next page ([project summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/project-summary/)), we explain more detailed project description with the experimental design as well as our main findings.
