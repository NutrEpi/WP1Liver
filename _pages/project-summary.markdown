## Background
The primary purpose of this study is to elucidate the effect of micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) on metabolic pathways from a genetic and epigenetic point of view. Specifically, our aim is to analyse and understand micronutrient influences in Atlantic salmon through [a whole life cycle feeding trial](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735551) (over 54 weeks for salmon) conducted under the EU funded [ARRAINA](https://www.arraina.eu/) (advanced research initiatives for nutrition and aquaculture) project.

With the rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry in the last two decades, we can hardly sustain traditional practices as feeding fish to grow other fish. Hence, aquaculture feeds have been shifted to containing more plant-based materials. Consequently, the optimised levels of nutrition, including micronutrient, are altered and need to be updated to produce healthier and more nutritious fish.

New knowledge regarding genetic and epigenetic regulations acquired through this project may contribute to the global effort on solving a word-wide problem of micronutrient deficiencies called "hidden hunger". Ending all forms of malnutrition including micronutrient deficiencies is one of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDGs) proposed by the UN.

## Feeding trial
Our analyses were based on the liver samples of Atlantic salmon fed with three graded levels of micronutrient supplementation. The main outcome of the feeding trail was summarised in [Vera et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735551).

### Experimental design
Liver samples were collected at the final harvest stage for gene expression and DNA methylation analysis.

### Experimental feed
Through the trial, triplicate groups - L1, L2, L3 - were fed with graded levels of micronutrient supplements, formulated with nutrition package (NP).
- L1: 100% NP (recommended composition of NP)
- L2: 200% NP
- L3: 400% NP

### Growth performance

#### Body weights
- Smolt: L2 showed the best growth followed by L3
- Harvest: Both L2 and L3 showed significantly better growth

#### Hepatosomatic index (HSI)
- `HSI = (Liver weight (g) / Fish weight (g)) Ã— 100`
- Smolt: L1 had a significantly higher HSI than L2 and L3
- Harvest: No significant difference among L1, L2 and L3
